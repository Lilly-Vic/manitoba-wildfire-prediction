# Manitoba Wildfire Prediction
This project focused on analyzing and categorizing wildfire risks in Manitoba using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), a standard meteorological tool for evaluating fire danger. The dataset included historical and current fire weather reports, fire occurrences, station names, date, and FWI components (Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code, Initial Spread Index, Buildup Index, and Fire Weather Index) from Manitoba Natural Resources and Northern Development website. These factors were used to compute FWI values, which were categorized into five risk classes: Low, Moderate, High, Very High, and Extreme.

Machine learning models were trained on the dataset to predict wildfire risk levels, enabling proactive response strategies. The project aimed to enhance wildfire management efforts by providing actionable insights for early warning systems and resource allocation. Metrics like R-squared (R²), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Training, and Testing Time were used to evaluate the performance of regression models such as Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Decision Tree Regressor, KNN Regressor, Multivariable Regression, and Polynomial Regression. The project demonstrated the potential of predictive analytics to mitigate wildfire impacts in Manitoba.
